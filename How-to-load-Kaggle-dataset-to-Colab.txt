How to save Kaggle dataset permanently on COLAB:

0. Go to your kaggle settings and generate an API, which downloads a JSON file.


1. Mount the notebook with Drive:
	from google.colab import drive
	drive.mount('/content/drive')


2. Upload that JSON file in COlAB Notebooks folder in drive.

3. Run these commands to load Kaggle.json API file from drive:
	!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
	!cp "/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/kaggle.json" ~/.kaggle/
	!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

4. Search any dataset on kaggle, copy the API command and run:
	!kaggle datasets download -d dataset-owner/dataset-name -p "/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks"


5. Use this for unzip and import dataset from drive:
	import zipfile
	with zipfile.ZipFile('/content/drive/MyDrive/dataset-name.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
    	zip_ref.extractall('/content/drive/MyDrive/dataset-folder')

6. Use these command to read a file uisng pandas:
	import pandas as pd
	df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/your_dataset.csv')
	df.head()

df.head() shows first 5 rows of data
